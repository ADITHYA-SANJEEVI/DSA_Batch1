Initialize a queue!
Check the queue is empty or not? Yes
Number of elements in queue: 0

Insert some elements into the queue:
Queue elements are: 1 2 3

Delete two elements from the said queue:
Queue elements are: 3 
Number of elements in queue: 1

Insert another element into the queue:
Queue elements are: 3 4 
Number of elements in the queue: 2*/
